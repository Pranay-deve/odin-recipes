    <hr><h2><strong><u>Description:</u></strong></h2>
    <p>Got this recipe for a Doritos casserole from a friend way back in junior high. It's super-simple and tastes delicious. My kids ask for it all the time. If you love enchiladas, you'll love this recipe.<br> You can use any flavor Doritos to suit your taste. When reheating leftover casserole, stir in a little bit of milk to make it creamy again.</p><hr>
    <h2><strong><u>Ingredients:</u></strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
