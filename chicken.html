    <hr><h2><strong><u>Description:</u></strong></h2>
    <p>'Huli Huli Chicken' (turn, turn) was invented by Ernest Morgado when he cooked teriyaki chicken for a group of farmers in 1955.<br> This has been a Hawaiian staple with sticky rice ever since. This is my family's version of Huli Huli Chicken. Use aji mirin (sweet rice wine) in place of sherry if desired.</p><hr>
    <h2><strong><u>Ingredients:</u></strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (3 pound) chickens, each cut into 8 pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened pineapple juice</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger, crushed</li>
        <li>⅓ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>4 green onions, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <hr><h2><strong><u>Steps:</u></strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse chicken pieces and pat dry with paper towels. Combine pineapple juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, ketchup, sherry, ginger, garlic,<br> green onions, and dry mustard in a large resealable plastic bag, stirring the marinade until brown sugar has dissolved.</li>
        <li>Move an oven rack 6 inches from heat source and preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade and arrange chicken, skin sides up, on a broiler pan.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken in preheated oven until browned on both sides and the juices run clear, turning every 10 minutes, 30 to 45 minutes. Baste with remaining marinade after each turning.<br> An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest piece of chicken, not touching bone, should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
